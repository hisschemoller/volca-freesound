              <p className={s.p}>
                Samples are transferred to the Volca using an old MODEM type
                signal. So once the app has downloaded an audio file from
                freesound.org, it&apos;s first converted inside the app. You can
                hear the signal if you start the app without the audio output
                being connected to a Volca. PLEASE NOTE: listen at low volume,
                because the the signal starts with a loud, high pitched beep.

                Some remarks on sample transfer and tips for best results:
              </p>
              <ul className={s.ol}>
                <li>
                  Transfer is quite slow. You can expect it to take about 13
                  times as long as a sample&apos;s duration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The computer&apos;s audio output is best set at - or close to
                  maximum volume.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use fresh batteries or a power adapter for more reliable
                  transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My own experience is that transfer is never very reliable. An
                  error will occur after 10 or 20 samples, even with the Volca
                  on a power adapter, a good quality soundcard and audio cable,
                  and carefully set volume level.
